    <p>My name is Christopher Brewer. I was born and have lived in the KC Metro for nearly all my life.
    </p>

    <p>I graduated from Johnson County Community College with an Associate of Arts in 2012</p>

    <p> I attended Missouri Baptist University in St. Louis on a wrestling scholarship.
    </p>

    <p> I am currently working as a Sales Rep for Southern Glazer's Wine & Spirits.
    </p>

    <p>I received my Level 1 certificate from the Court of Master Sommeliers in 2014</p>

    <p>Though I still enjoy wine, I would like to change careers and become a web developer.</p>

    <p>I am attaining the skills necessary to compete in todays market, and fulfil my dream</p>
